@article{sebastiani2007lazy,
    abstract = {Satisfiability Modulo Theories ({SMT}) is the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a first-order formula with respect to some decidable first-order theory T ({SMT}(T)). These problems are typically not handled adequately by standard automated theorem provers. {SMT} is being recognized as increasingly important due to its applications in many domains in different communities, in particular in formal verification. An amount of papers with novel and very efficient techniques for {SMT} has been published in the last years, and some very efficient {SMT} tools are now available. Typical {SMT}(T) problems require testing the satisfiability of formulas which are Boolean combinations of atomic propositions and atomic expressions in T , so that heavy Boolean reasoning must be efficiently combined with expressive theory-specific reasoning. The dom- inating approach to {SMT}(T), called lazy approach, is based on the integration of a {SAT} solver and of a decision procedure able to handle sets of atomic constraints in T (T-solver), handling respectively the Boolean and the theory-specific components of reasoning. Unfortunately, neither the problem of building an efficient {SMT} solver, nor even that of acquiring a comprehensive background knowledge in lazy {SMT}, is of simple solution. In this paper we present an extensive survey of {SMT}, with particular focus on the lazy approach. We survey, classify and analyze from a theory-independent perspective the most effective techniques and optimizations which are of interest for lazy {SMT} and which have been proposed in various communities; we discuss their relative benefits and drawbacks; we provide some guidelines about their choice and usage; we also analyze the features for {SAT} solvers and T-solvers which make them more suitable for an integration. The ultimate goals of this paper are to become a source of a common background knowledge and terminology for students and researchers in different areas, to provide a reference guide for developers of {SMT} tools, and to stimulate the cross-fertilization of techniques and ideas among different communities.},

  is based on the C library GiNaC, supporting the symbolic representation
  and manipulation of polynomials. In contrast to other similar tools,
  our open source library aids exact, real algebraic computations based
  on an appropriate data type representing real zeros of polynomials.
  The only non-standard library GiNaCRA depends on is GiNaC, which
  makes the installation and usage of our library simple. Our long-term
  goal is to integrate decision procedures for real algebra within
  the Satisﬁability-Modulo-Theories (SMT) context and thereby provide
  tool support for many applied formal methods. },

                Haskell, Prolog, and term rewrite systems (TRSs).

                To analyze programs in high-level languages, AProVE automatically converts them
                to TRSs. Then, a wide range of techniques is employed to prove termination and to
                infer complexity bounds for the resulting TRSs.

                The generated proofs can be exported to check their correctness using automatic
                certifiers. For use in software construction, we present an AProVE plug-in for
