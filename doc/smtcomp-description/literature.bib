This paper explores whether using explainable AI (XAI) techniques on such ML models can offer new insight for symbolic computation, inspiring new implementations within computer algebra systems that do not directly call upon AI tools. We present a case study on the use of ML to select the variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition. It has already been demonstrated that ML can make the choice well, but here we show how the SHAP tool for explainability can be used to inform new heuristics of a size and complexity similar to those human-designed heuristics currently commonly used in symbolic computation.},

  abstract = {The cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) is currently the only complete method used in practise for answering questions about real algebra, despite its doubly exponential complexity. Recently, some novel algorithms like NLSAT, CAlC and NuCAD for satisfiability checking respectively quantifier elimination have been proposed, which build on the CAD idea to generalize a sample point to a connected set (cell) of points that share certain properties with the sample. This process is called single cell construction. In this paper, we adapt this method to potentially generate bigger cells by detecting that certain adjacent cells maintain those relevant invariance properties. For formalizing the resulting algorithm in this paper, we generalize the notion of delineability to local delineability. An experimental evaluation of a first implementation in NLSAT is provided.},
