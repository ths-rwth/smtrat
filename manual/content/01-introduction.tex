\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:intro}
This manual describes \smtrat, a \Cpp library consisting of a collection of
SMT-compliant implementations of methods for solving \supportedLogicsText 
formulas, we refer to as modules. These modules can be 
combined to (1) a theory solver in order to extend the supported logics of an
existing SMT solver by \supportedLogics or (2) an SMT solver for \supportedLogics. 
The latter is especially intended to be a testing environment for the development 
of SMT compliant implementations of further methods tackling \supportedLogics.
\smtrat specifies dynamically which modules have to solve a 
given \supportedLogics formula, involving the formula's properties and the solving 
history.
